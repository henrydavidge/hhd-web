I'm a first year graduate student at [MIT](https://mit.edu) where I'm advised by [Dina Katabi](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dina/).
Previously, I was a software engineer at [Databricks](https://databricks.com) from 2014 until 2021.

I'm interested in how we can use data to make healthcare more effective, affordable, and available.
